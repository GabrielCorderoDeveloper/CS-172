# The Quest for the Lost Treasure - Text-Based Adventure Game

## Overview
Welcome to **The Quest for the Lost Treasure**, a text-based adventure game created for a CS172 term project. In this game, you'll journey through the Forbidden Forest, facing challenges and making decisions that affect your health points (HP) and progress toward finding the legendary Lost Treasure. Can you survive all 15 steps and reach the treasure? Let’s find out!

## Story
You’re an adventurer on a quest through the mysterious Forbidden Forest. It’s filled with all kinds of dangers, unexpected encounters, and decisions that will test your courage and skills. The goal? Get to the Lost Treasure of the Forbidden Forest with some HP left in the tank!

## Game Rules
- **Objective:** Complete all 15 steps to find the treasure and keep your HP above zero.
- **HP Management:** You start with 100 HP. Depending on your choices, your HP can go up or down. If you hit zero, it’s game over!
- **Encounters:** You'll come across five main encounters at specific steps, each with different choices that can impact your HP and progress.
- **Random Events:** Some steps throw random events your way, like animal attacks, healing herbs, or obstacles.
- **Endings:** The game has three possible endings: Victory (reach the treasure with HP left), Survivor (run out of steps but survive), or Failure (lose all HP).

## Project Structure
This project is broken down into:
1. **Player Class:** Handles your character’s stats like name, HP, and step count.
2. **Adventure Class:** Manages story progression, encounters, and random events.
3. **Functions:** Each encounter has its own function, as well as functions for managing choices and random events.
4. **Conditionals and Loops:** Controls game flow, branching paths, and prompts if you make an invalid choice.

## How to Play
- At each step, you’ll be presented with choices. Pick wisely—they’ll affect your HP or step count!
- Keep an eye out for random events that can help or hinder you.
- The game keeps going until you reach the treasure, lose all HP, or survive without finding it.
